This module uses PayPal or Bitcoin as the backend, rather than storing money on the server.

This means all transactions are real hard transactions. 

By default, this module sets the rate at OS$1 = 1 US Cent, eg - OS$300 = US$3.00. 

PayPal payments are confirmed by the buyer through PayPal's standard purchasing interface; 
the simulator is then notified via PayPal IPN of the payment - and will process the original request.

Bitcoin payments are confirmed by an external monitoring service. We are currently using bitcoinmonitor.net.


Configuring this module:
Add the following sections to your OpenSim.ini file

TODO: Add the Bitcoin stuf.

[PayPal]
    Enabled = true
    
    ; The URL to reference PayPal by
    ; can be either www.paypal.com or www.sandbox.paypal.com
    PayPalURL = www.paypal.com
    
    ; Fetch email addresses from User grid service; default is false
    AllowGridEmails = true
    
    ; Allow group PayPal accounts; default is false
    AllowGroups = true
        
[PayPal Users]
; Addresses of Recievers/Sellers PP user accounts
; One per line, ie:
Adam Frisby="adam@deepthink.com.au"
Snoopy Pfeffer="snoopy.pfeffer@yahoo.com"
;Plaza Builder="donations.osgrid@gmail.com"
; ...

[PayPal Groups]
; Addresses of Recievers/Sellers PP group accounts
; One per line, ie:
;a683cc8a-a5cc-4c40-87bc-ebcfbcfb1456="mygroup.account@yahoo.com"
; ...


How the PayPal Users section is formatted:
One line per user, this should be the avatar name. The email address is the 
primary email address used for the PayPal account that their funds will be 
received by. Users not listed in this section will not be able to receive 
funds unless AllowGridEmails is set to true (however any user can send them.)

How the PayPal Groups section is formatted:
One line per group, this should be the group uuid. The email address is the 
primary email address used for the PayPal account that their funds will be 
received by. Groups not listed in this section will not be able to receive 
funds.
